He still startles easily and will need a home on the calm side so he can feel confident at his own pace. This little cutie has a whole lifetime of affection to soak in from his new family!",

Charlie Brown is a delightful and friendly boy who is ready to find someone to give him all the good things in life!`,

Barracuda especially enjoyed climbing, jumping, and chasing her toys. She loves being around other cats, and was even O.K. with the dog in the home, as long as he didn't get too much in her face! She is very shy about meeting new people and it takes some extra time and patience to get to know her. The way to her heart is through treats! Barracuda will be a happy girl when she finds her forever home and someone to give her all the love she deserves!`,
